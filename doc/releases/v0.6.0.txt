v0.6.0 (Unreleased)
-------------------

This is a major release from 0.5. The main objective of this release is to unify the API for categorical plots, which means that there are some relatively large API changes in some of the older functions. See below for details of those changes, which may break code written for older versions of seaborn. There are also some new functions (:func:`stripplot`,  and :func:`countplot`), enhancements to existing functions, and bug fixes.

Additionally, the structure of the docs is changing in version 0.6. The API docs page for each function will have numerous examples with embedded plots showing how to use the various options. These pages should be considered the most comprehensive resource for examples, as the tutorial pages are going to be streamlined to provide a higher-level introduction. Currently there are examples for all the categorical plot functions, it's unclear whether they will be completed for the rest of the package by release.

Changes and updates to categorical plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In version 0.6, the "categorical" plots have been unified with a common API. This new category of functions groups together plots that show the relationship between one numeric variable and one or two categorical variables. This includes plots that show distribution of the numeric variable in each bin (:func:`barplot`, :func:`pointplot`, and :func:`stripplot`) and plots that apply a statistical estimation within each bin (:func:`pointplot` and :func:`barplot`).

These functions now each accept the same formats of input data and can be invoked in the same way. The can plot using long- or wide-form data, and can be drawn vertically or horizontally. When long-form data is used, the orientation of the plots is inferred from the types of the input data. Additionally, all functions natively take a ``hue`` variable to add a second layer of categorization.

With the (in some cases new) API, these functions can all be drawn correctly by :class:`FacetGrid`. However, :func:`factorplot` can also now create faceted verisons of any of these kinds of plots, so in most cases it will be unnecessary to use :class:`FacetGrid` directly.. By default, :func:`factorplot` draws a point plot, but this is controlled by the ``kind`` parameter.

Here are details on what has changed in the process of unifying these APIs:

- Changes to :func:`boxplot` and :func:`violinplot` will probably be the most disruptive. Both functions maintain backwards-compatibility in terms of the kind of data they can accept, but the syntax has changed to be more similar to other seaborn functions. These functions are now invoked with ``x`` and/or ``y`` parameters that are either vectors of data or names of variables in a long-form DataFrame passed to the new ``data`` parameter. You can still pass wide-form DataFrames or arrays to ``data``, but it is no longer the first positional argument. See the `github pull request <https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/pull/410>`_ for more information on these changes and the logic behind them.

- As :func:`pointplot` and :func:`barplot` can now plot with the major categorical variable on the y axis, the ``x_order`` parameter has been renamed to ``order``.

- Added a ``hue`` argument to :func:`boxplot` and :func:`violinplot`, which allows for nested grouping the plot elements by a third categorical variable. For :func:`violinplot`, this nesting can also be accomplished by splitting the violins when there are two levels of the ``hue`` variable (using ``split=True``). To make this functionality feasible, the ability to specify where the plots will be draw in data coordinates has been removed. These plots now are drawn at set positions, like (and identical to) :func:`barplot` and :func:`pointplot`.

- Added a ``palette`` parameter to :func:`boxplot`/:func:`violinplot`. The ``color`` parameter still exists, but no longer does double-duty in accepting the name of a seaborn palette. ``palette`` supersedes ``color`` so that it can be used with a :class:`FacetGrid`.

Along with these API changes, the following changes/enhancements were made to the plotting functions:

- The default rules for ordering the categories has changed. Instead of automatically sorting the category levels, the plots now show the levels in the order the appear in the input data (i.e., the order given by ``Series.unique()``). Order can be specified when plotting with the ``order`` and ``hue_order`` parameters. Additionally, when variables are pandas objects with a "categorical" dtype, the category order is inferred from the data object. This change also affects :class:`FacetGrid` and :class:`PairGrid`.

- Added the ``scale`` and ``scale_hue`` parameters to :func:`violinplot`. These control how the width of the violins are scaled. The default is ``area``, which is different from how the violins used to be drawn. Use ``scale='width'`` to get the old behavior.

- Used a different style for the ``box`` kind of interior plot in :func:`violinplot`, which shows the whisker range in addition to the quartiles. Use ``inner='quartile'`` to get the old style.

New plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the :func:`stripplot` function, which draws a scatterplot where one of the variables is categorical. This plot has the same API as :func:`boxplot` and :func:`violinplot`. It is useful both on its own and when composed with one of these other plot kinds to show both the observations and underlying distribution.

- Added the :func:`countplot` function, which uses a bar plot representation to show counts of variables in one or more categorical bins. This replaces the old approach of calling :func:`barplot` without a numeric variable.

Other additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the ``seaborn.crayons`` dictionary and the :func:`crayon_palette` function to define colors from the 120 box (!) of `Crayola crayons <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors>`_.

- Added the ``line_kws`` parameter to :func:`residplot` to change the style of the lowess line, when used.

- Added open-ended ``**kwargs`` to the ``add_legend`` method on :class:`FacetGrid` and :class:`PairGrid`, which will pass additional keyword arguments through when calling the legend function on the ``Figure`` or ``Axes``.

- Added the ``gridspec_kws`` parameter to :class:`FacetGrid`, which allows for control over the size of individual facets in the grid to emphasize certain plots or account for differences in variable ranges.

- The interactive palette widgets now show a continuous colorbar, rather than a discrete palette, when `as_cmap` is True.

- Added a catch in :func:`distplot` when calculating a default number of bins. For highly skewed data it will now use 10 bins, where previously the reference rule would return "infinite" bins and cause an exception in matplotlib.

- :func:`heatmap` and :func:`clustermap` now automatically use a mask for missing values, which previously were shown with the "under" value of the colormap per default `plt.pcolormesh` behavior.

- The various property dictionaries that can be passed to ``plt.boxplot`` are now applied after the seaborn restyling to allow for full customizability.

- Added a ceiling (50) to the default number of bins used for :func:`distplot` histograms. This will help avoid confusing errors with certain kinds of datasets that heavily violate the assumptions of the reference rule used to get a default number of bins. The ceiling is not applied when passing a specific number of bins.

- Added a ``savefig`` method to :class:`JointGrid` that defaults to a tight bounding box to make it easier to save figures using this class.

- Changed the default ``linewidths`` in :func:`heatmap` and :`clustermap` to 0 so that larger matrices plot correctly. This parameter still exists and can be used to get the old effect of lines demarcating each cell in the heatmap (the old default ``linewidths`` was 0.5).

- You can now pass an integer to the ``xticklabels`` and ``yticklabels`` parameter of :func:`heatmap` (and, by extension, :func:`clustermap`). This will make the plot use the ticklabels inferred from the data, but only plot every ``n`` label, where ``n`` is the number you pass. This can help when visualizing larger matrices with some sensible ordering to the rows or columns of the dataframe.

- Added the :func:`set_color_codes` function and the ``color_codes`` argument to :func:`set` and :func:`set_palette`. This changes the interpretation of shorthand color codes (i.e. "b", "g", k", etc.) within matplotlib to use the values from one of the named seaborn palettes (i.e. "deep", "muted", etc.). That makes it easier to have a more uniform look when using matplotlib functions directly with seaborn imported. This could be disruptive to existing plots, so it does not happen by default. It is possible this could change in the future.

- Added the ``as_hex`` method to color palette objects, to return a list of hex codes rather than rgb tuples.

- The :func:`color_palette` function no longer trims palettes that are longer than 6 colors when passed into it.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bugs in :func:`clustermap` where the mask and specified ticklabels were not being reorganized using the dendrograms.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`FacetGrid` and :class:`PairGrid` that lead to incorrect legend labels when levels of the ``hue`` variable appeared in ``hue_order`` but not in the data.

- Fixed a bug in :meth:`FacetGrid.set_xticklabels` or :meth:`FacetGrid.set_yticklabels` when ``col_wrap`` is being used.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`PairGrid` where the ``hue_order`` parameter was ignored.
